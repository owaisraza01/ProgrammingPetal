        <p>Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. and the open-source community, first released in 2014. Swift was developed as a replacement for Apple's earlier programming language Objective-C, as Objective-C had been largely unchanged since the early 1980s and lacked modern language features. Swift works with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, and a key aspect of Swift's design was the ability to interoperate with the huge body of existing Objective-C code developed for Apple products over the previous decades. It is built with the open source LLVM compiler framework and has been included in Xcode since version 6, released in 2014. On Apple platforms, it uses the Objective-C runtime library which allows C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>What is Swift and why should you use it?</h2>
        <p> Swift is a compiled programming language for iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and Linux applications. Here’s what you need to know about Swift.
          Created by Apple in 2014. Backed up by one of the most influential tech companies in the world, Swift is set to become the dominant language for iOS development and beyond.
          Open source. Swift creators acknowledged the fact that in order to build a defining programming language, the technology needs to be open for all. So, within its three years of existence, Swift acquired a large supportive community and an abundance of third-party tools.Safe. Its syntax encourages you to write clean and consistent code which may even feel strict at times. Swift provides safeguards to prevent errors and improve readability.
        </p>
        <h3>Feature of Swift</h3>
        <p>Swift makes use of safe programming patterns.
          Swift provides modern programming features.
          Swift provides Objective-C like syntax.
          Swift is a fantastic way to write iOS and OS X apps.
          Swift provides seamless access to existing Cocoa frameworks.
          Swift unifies the procedural and object-oriented portions of the language.
          Swift does not need a separate library import to support functionalities like input/output or string handling..</p>
        <h3>What Is a Class of swift programming Language?</h3>
        <p>Classes in Swift 4 are building blocks of flexible constructs. Similar to constants, variables and functions the user can define class properties and methods. Swift 4 provides us the functionality that while declaring classes the users need not create interfaces or implementation files. Swift 4 allows us to create classes as a single file and the external interfaces will be created by default once the classes are initialized.

          Benefits of having Classes:
          Inheritance acquires the properties of one class to another class
          
          Type casting enables the user to check class type at run time
          
          Deinitializers take care of releasing memory resources
          
          Reference counting allows the class instance to have more than one reference
          
          Common Characteristics of Classes and structures
          Properties are defined to store values
          Subscripts are defined for providing access to values
          Methods are initialized to improve functionality
          Initial state are defined by initializers
          Functionality are expanded beyond default values
          Confirming protocol functionality standards.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">What Is a Function of Swift program?</h2>
        <p>A function is a set of statements organized together to perform a specific task. A Swift 4 function can be as simple as a simple C function to as complex as an Objective C language function. It allows us to pass local and global parameter values inside the function calls.

          Function Declaration − tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters.
          
          Function Definition − It provides the actual body of the function.

      </article>
        <p>A comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a program. It is ignored by the compiler when the code is compiled.

          Comments are intended for person reading the code to better understand the intent and functionality of the program. It can be helpful while working on a team to clarify the purpose of the code for other team members or while working solely it can act as a reminder to own.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">What Swift Means for the Future of I.T?</h2>
            <p>With 800 million iOS devices sold, MacBooks being prevalent at most developer conferences, and Macs often used in educational institutions, it’s clear that Swift will have a huge impact on client-side development in the I.T. industry. (Swift, of course, will have no impact on Microsoft .NET shops that use C# for back end development.)

              Apple clearly intends Swift to eventually replace Objective-C. Swift is simple enough to learn—and playgrounds are learner-friendly enough—that Swift could become the default language for teaching programming, perhaps displacing Java. Yet Swift is powerful enough for any enterprise coding requirement.
              
              With new college graduates learning Swift to program their iOS devices, and existing developers tinkering with it at home and on the job, iOS (and OS X) developers will become much more prevalent, easier to hire, and less expensive over time. </p>

                <h2 class="blog-post-title">What Is the Advantages of swift Programming?</h2>
                <p>Easy to Read and Maintain
                  The Swift program codes are near to natural English which is a blessing of syntaxes taken from programming languages such as Python, C#, and Ruby. The simple syntax of this language makes it more expressive.
                  
                  [post_middile_section_ad]
                  
                  Scalable
                  It is easy to add new features to this language which makes it a scalable one. And for the future scope, you must know that Apple is relying on Swift rather than Objective-C.
                  
                  Concise
                  The language does not contain lengthy lines of code as the developers of Swift wanted to use concise syntax. In other words, a Swift programming code is capable of replacing around 70% of Objective-C mobile application development coding. This increases the development and testing rate of the program. Thus, making the Swift a cheaply maintained language.
                  
                  Safety and Improved Performance
                  The speed and performance of Swift have already been proved in earlier points. It is almost 40% better than the Objective-C when speed and performance are taken into considerations. The bugs present in your Swift codes are easy to tackle when compared with other programming languages. Its robustness and bug fixing functionality leads to a safer environment.
                  
                  Cross-device Support
                  This language is not only limited to iOS and iOS X apps. But it is also capable of handling other Apple platforms like MacOS, tvOS, and watchOS.
                  
                  Automatic Memory Management
                  The feature of Automatic Memory Management prevents the memory leaks. It also helps in optimizing your application’s performance. To achieve this, Swift makes use of Automatic Reference Counting.

                  Problems with the Compatibility
                  With the consistent changes in the newer versions of Apple, Swift has been appeared as somewhat unstable. The updated versions of the Swift code face a few of the issues. Now, to fix these issues, you will consider shifting your project to a newer version of Swift which is a costly affair.
                  
                  Speed Issues
                  The speed issues arise when we talk about the earlier versions of the Swift programming language..</p>

                    <p>Each of these language ranges in usability and ease of learning. Python is considered the best beginner programming language. It is easy to learn and to deploy. Java has been a popular language for many decades. It is the official language for Android apps. C and C++ are considered the foundational languages for many operating systems and file systems. JavaScript is popular for front end developers because it helps make applications look clean and clear for the user. Swift is a native iOS language and has been growing in popularity as Mac and Apple products become industry favorites.</p>
