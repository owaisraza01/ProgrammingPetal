        <p>The name "Ruby" originated during an online chat session between Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka on February 24, 1993, before any code had been written for the language.Initially two names were proposed: "Coral" and "Ruby". Matsumoto chose the latter in a later e-mail to Ishitsuka. Matsumoto later noted a factor in choosing the name "Ruby" – it was the birthstone of one of his colleagues.</p>

        <h2>What is Ruby and why should you use it</h2>
        <p>Ruby was originally designed with the goal of making programming fun, and in Japan, where it came from, Ruby was used to make games. Ruby is succinct and reads like English, which makes the code easy to understand for coding beginners.

          Since you'll be able to build prototypes quickly with Ruby on Rails, many find coding in Ruby a satisfying experience.
          
          Flexible:
          As a dynamically typed language, Ruby does not have hard rules on how to build features, and it is very close to spoken languages. You'll have more flexibility solving problems using different methods. Furthermore, Ruby is also more forgiving of errors, so you'll still be able to compile and run your program until you hit the problematic part.</p>
        <h3>Feature of Ruby</h3>
        <p>A program Ruby is an open-source and is freely available on the Web, but it is subject to a license.
          Ruby is a general-purpose, interpreted programming language.
          Ruby is a true object-oriented programming language.
          Ruby is a server-side scripting language similar to Python and PERL.
          Ruby can be used to write Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts.</p>
        <h3>What Is a Class of Ruby program?</h3>
        <p>Ruby is an ideal object-oriented programming language. The features of an object-oriented programming language include data encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, data abstraction, operator overloading etc. In object-oriented programming classes and objects plays an important role.
          A class is a blueprint from which objects are created. The object is also called as an instance of a class. For Example, the animal is a class and mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians are the instances of the class. Similarly, the sales department is the class and the objects of the class are sales data, sales manager, and secretary.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">What Is a Function of Ruby Program</h2>
        <p>Function is a set of codes written together and given a name. We can call that set of program at any place of our code by just calling its name and without writing the whole set of codes again.Ruby Function (method) Syntax. The Ruby language makes it easy to create functions. Your function can compute values and store them in local variables that are specific to the function. Those values can then be returned with the return statement.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Why Is it Important to Know About Computer Programming?</h2>
            <p>If you are thinking about earning your computer programming degree, you will need to know about programming languages, classes, functions and commands. You will create applications, software or different programs. In addition, you may create programs that need to work on various operating systems such as iOS or Android. Those programs have different functions and classes, which means they rely on different programming languages.<br>All applications on the web are created using computer programming. The languages used in each application you have range from similar to vastly different. Additionally, some languages create things that are running in the background, so you do not even know they are there. Learning computer programming languages allows you to be a versatile computer programmer.</p>

                <h2 class="blog-post-title">What Is the Future Impact of Computer Programming?</h2>
                <p>Technology production is an essential part of an evolving world. This means that computer programming is exceptionally important for our future as a global society. Computer programming degree graduates can help create this future by automating processes, collecting data, analyzing information and sharing knowledge to continuously innovate and improve upon existing processes.<br>This means that, while computer programming is extremely important today, it may be even more impactful in the future. As computer programmers across the world work to learn new ways of communicating with machines and computers, the field will continue to grow. Earning your computer programming degree now means you can be part of that research and testing to develop functions that can help society.<br>Computer programming is important today because so much of our world is automated. Humans need to be able to control the interaction between people and machines. Since computers and machines are able to do things so efficiently and accurately, we use computer programming to harness that computing power.</p>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-title">What Are the Important Computer Programming Languages to Learn?</h2>
                    <p>Computer programming is evolving and so are the languages that are used to develop software and applications. Different programming languages are used for different categories of developers. Some languages are best for beginners, while others are more suited for advanced computer programmers. In addition, some languages are best for different use cases such as web apps, mobile apps and distributed systems.<br>The best way to determine what programming languages to learn is to know what skills you will need in order to be a successful computer programmer.<br>Popular and important computer programming languages based on necessity and application include:</p>
                    <ul style="color: white;">
                        <li>Pyhton</li>
                        <li>Java</li>
                        <li>C/C++</li>
                        <li>Javascript</li>
                        <li>React</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each of these language ranges in usability and ease of learning. Python is considered the best beginner programming language. It is easy to learn and to deploy. Java has been a popular language for many decades. It is the official language for Android apps. C and C++ are considered the foundational languages for many operating systems and file systems. JavaScript is popular for front end developers because it helps make applications look clean and clear for the user. Swift is a native iOS language and has been growing in popularity as Mac and Apple products become industry favorites.</p>
